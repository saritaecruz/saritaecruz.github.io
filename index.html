      <h2>Why Books Mean so Much to Me</h2>
      <p>Reading to me, is fun. I always get people telling me that reading is boring and nerdy. But I find reading really interesting. It takes you to this place you never knew or you imagined yourself. You follow these characters throughout the story and yes you may not actually be in the book but you're experiencing the same things they are so it feels like your apart of them. Books take you on the wildest of rides. It teaches you things you don't learn in classrooms. I may be nerdy because I love to follow and grow with these characters but once you get pulled in, it all just feels so real.</p>

      <h2>Why Music Means so Much to Me</h2>
      <p>Music is extaordinary. There's a song for whatever you are feeling. I didn't expand my music tastes until I was out of high school. And I think if I found that music while I was in high school, it would've been easier. I just love that feeling you get when you here a song you know is going to change your life. For me, that band was Queen. Some of Queen's songs may be hard to interpret but I think it just depends on who is listening to it. Their famous song Bohemian Rhapsody, no one actually knows the meaning behind those lyrics except for the band themselves but everyone who listens, they come up with their own meaning, one that they need for it to be.</p>
